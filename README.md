# Joseki Sage

A browser-based Go joseki training application.

Live app: [**josekisage.github.io/Joseki-Sage**](https://josekisage.github.io/Joseki-Sage/)

\---

## Overview

Joseki Sage lets you build a personal joseki library, study sequences in an interactive editor, and test your recall in a fully-featured practice mode. It runs entirely in the browser as a single HTML file — no server, no account, no installation required. Your custom library can be synced across devices using Google Drive.

\---

## Features

### Library

* Organize joseki into folders (Default and Custom libraries)
* Enable or disable joseki for practice individually or by folder
* Real-time search across joseki names and folder names
* Import and export your full library as JSON
* Default library fetched automatically on first visit when served over HTTP
* **Google Drive sync** keeps your custom library automatically up to date across all devices and browsers

### Editor

* Fully model any sequence of moves on all three sizes of commonly played boards (9×9, 13×13, 19×19)
* Full board view, half-board, and quarter-board cropped views with rotation
* Annotate positions with letters (A–Z) or triangle markers
* Write position comments for any node in the tree
* Create conditional setup branches to explore how joseki change when specific stones exist elsewhere on the board (e.g. ladder breakers)
* Import and export individual joseki as SGF files
* Full tree navigator with zoom and drag
* Flag board positions in the tree for later review

### Practice Mode

* Randomly assigned player color (or choose first/second player)
* Correct continuations scored with streak multiplier (up to 3×)
* Wrong moves reveal valid alternatives
* Hint button shows all valid continuations
* Random board mirroring and color inversion for pattern recognition training
* Start practice from any node in the joseki tree
* Seamless switching between joseki when a move is valid in multiple sequences
* Show Annotations mode pauses only when a position has a comment or annotation
* Settings panel with toggles for hints, annotations, scoring, and transforms
* Session statistics: score, accuracy, streak

## Installation \& Usage

### Online (GitHub Pages)

Visit [josekisage.github.io/Joseki-Sage](https://josekisage.github.io/Joseki-Sage/) in any modern browser. No installation required.

### Progressive Web App (PWA)

Joseki Sage can be installed as a PWA for a native app-like experience:

**Android (Chrome or Firefox):**

1. Open the app in your browser
2. Tap the browser menu (⋮)
3. Select "Add to Home Screen" or "Install app"
4. Confirm — the app will appear on your home screen

**iOS (Safari):**

1. Open the app in Safari
2. Tap the Share button (□↑)
3. Select "Add to Home Screen"
4. Confirm

**Desktop (Chrome/Edge):**

1. Open the app
2. Click the install icon (⊕) in the address bar, or use the browser menu
3. Click "Install"

Once installed, Joseki Sage works offline after the first visit.

### Offline (standalone file)

The app can be downloaded as a fully self-contained file directly from this repository. Download `index.html`, save it anywhere on your device, and open it in any browser — no internet connection required. Note that Google Drive sync is not available in the offline file.

## Data Management

### Manual export and import

Your joseki library is stored in your browser's local storage. To transfer your library between browsers or devices:

1. In the app, open the **Download** menu in the top bar
2. Click **Custom Library** or **Default Library** to download as a JSON file
3. On the target browser/device, use **Import** to load the file

Importing a library replaces the existing one entirely. Keep exported backups of important libraries.

### Google Drive sync

Joseki Sage supports automatic cross-device sync via Google Drive. Once connected, your custom library is saved to Drive automatically after any change and fetched silently on startup.

**To connect:** Tap the **Drive** button in the library top bar → **Connect Google Drive** → sign in and grant permission. The app can only access a single file it creates (`joseki-custom-library.json`) — it cannot see any other files in your Drive.

**What is synced:** Your Custom Library only. The Default Library is shared content and is not synced. The `drive.file` OAuth scope is used, which is the narrowest permission available.

**Token expiry:** Google sessions expire after \~1 hour. The Drive button shows an error indicator when this happens. You may tap it and select Reconnect.

\---

## Architecture

Joseki Sage is a single-file React application compiled at runtime via Babel standalone. There is no build step — the HTML file is the complete application.

* **React 18** with Babel standalone (JSX in the browser)
* **Web Audio API** for stone placement sounds (zero latency, no audio files)
* **localStorage** for library persistence
* **Google Drive API** with OAuth 2.0 (`drive.file` scope) for optional cross-device sync
* **Service worker** for PWA offline support
